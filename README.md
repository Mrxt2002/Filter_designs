# Window Functions for Filter Design

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository focused on window functions for designing low-pass and high-pass filters. This project explores popular window functions, including Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, and Rectangular, highlighting their applications in signal processing and filter design.

## Window Functions Overview
Window functions play a crucial role in signal processing by shaping the frequency response of filters. Understanding various window functions is essential for tailoring filter characteristics to specific requirements.

### Window Functions Explored
1. **Hanning Window:**
   - Smooth tapering at the edges.
   - Minimizes side lobes for improved frequency response.

2. **Hamming Window:**
   - Similar to Hanning but with reduced side lobe levels.
   - Suitable for applications where side lobe suppression is critical.

3. **Blackman Window:**
   - Offers improved side lobe suppression compared to Hanning and Hamming.
   - Provides better control over filter characteristics.

4. **Rectangular Window:**
   - Simplest window function with a constant value.
   - Easy to implement but may lead to poor frequency response.

## Low-Pass and High-Pass Filter Design
Explore the application of these window functions in designing low-pass and high-pass filters. Understand how the choice of window function influences the filter's characteristics, such as transition band width, side lobe levels, and stopband attenuation.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Explore folders dedicated to each window function.
3. Access MATLAB scripts for implementing low-pass and high-pass filters using the specified window functions.
4. Run scripts to visualize and analyze filter responses.
